# air up Code Challenge

Welcome, we are happy that you are interested to join air-up and our dev team, the purpose of this code challenge is to see your skills as a developer and team member.
So give your best, and show off your dev skills, we want to see how you code.

## Challenge

At air-up we like to use SVGs, we used it for everything; the Digital Product department has sent us a new requirement:

---

#### **Intro**

For our polygon images, it is necessary to add a label in the **_Pole of inaccessibility_** to give proper information about the image

#### **Acceptance Criteria**

- The app can load SVGs
- The app can calculate the pole of inaccessibility of the upload SVG
- The app can place a label in the point of inaccessibility

---

Hint: all our SVG images are polygons.

Extra points:

- The app can store the SVG and its labels
- The app can preview the history of all SVGs with their corresponding labels
- There are implemented unit tests
- the app is deployed and there is a CI/CD pipeline

#### _Final Comment_

Please don't use any library to calculate the pole of inaccessibility, we would like to see how you implement your own algorithm.

Apart from that, you can use other libraries, but please leave an explanatory README of your decisions to choose the libraries and how to run the project.

You can also make other assumptions, but try to comment why did you make it.

This is private repository just for you and our dev team.

#### What we want to see

- clean code
- clean and relevant commits
- well structured files and components

#### When you are done

Please create a pull request 24 hours before our interview.

> Consider that any commit done after the deadline (24 hours before your interview) will not be taken into account

Best of lucks
